### Description
This project is a 2-player competitive boxing game where each user controls the 2 arms of a wooden “boxer” and attempts to strike their opponent’s “boxer” in the center with the arms. Users control the arms by pressing 2 buttons that correspond to each of the arms. The code here is for the Arduinos that takes input from the buttons and moves the corresponding servo motors attached to the arms.
