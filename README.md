### Description
This project is a 2-player competitive boxing game where each user controls the 2 arms of a wooden “boxer” and attempts to strike their opponent’s “boxer” in the center with the arms. Users control the arms by pressing 2 buttons that correspond to each of the arms. This repo contains the CAD files for the project and the code for the Arduinos that take input from the buttons and move the corresponding servo motors attached to the arms.
